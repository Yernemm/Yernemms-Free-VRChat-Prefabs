# 2024 New Year's Glasses

Free to use for whatever you want :\^)

Requirements: VRCFury, Audiolink, Poiyomi Toon (or setup your own materials)

To install, drag onto your head bone (VRCFury will make the toggle for you)

This is scaled around Rusk's head, so may require some rescaling for other avatars.

Includes a physbone that rotates the glasses up and down, but that's probably broken on Quest (uses a parent constraint)

(Crediting not required, but appreciated!)
